# Low-precision feature selection for wearable and microarray data
This repository includes the following resources:

* @fixp: fixp class, fixed-point representation. Property of G. Meurant, modified by S. Suárez-Marcote.

* fixp: methods of class fixp. Property of G. Meurant, modified by S. Suárez-Marcote.

* f_d_floatp : auxiliary methods for fixp class. Property of G. Meurant, modified by S. Suárez-Marcote.

* Base_Implementation: implementation of selection methods with support for fixed-point representation.

* Logarithmic_Division: implementation of selection methods with support for fixed-point representation using logarithmic division.

Rounding mode can be selected with function f_d_init_round (1-nearest, 5-stoch).
